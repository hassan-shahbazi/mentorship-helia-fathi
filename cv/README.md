# CV

This directory contains CV files for both Hassan and Helia. The aim is to ensure the CV is in a good style and contains valuable contents.

## Some points to consider

- Use [novoresume](https://novoresume.com/) to build a nice and clean CV (you can use mine as a reference)
- Add only necessary contents. Don't add points that you cannot defend.
- Make it as short as possible. CV should brings you an interview, and nothing more.

Good Luck!
